## CEO Statement

**Sarah Chen, Chief Executive Officer, commented:**

"FY2025 has been an exceptional year for SnowTelco. We have delivered strong financial performance across both our B2B and Consumer Mobile segments, demonstrating the success of our diversified telecommunications strategy.

In our B2B business, we continue to benefit from the structural shift to cloud-based unified communications. Our Horizon platform now serves over 185,000 users, and our contact centre solutions are gaining significant traction in the enterprise market. Customer retention remains excellent, with net revenue retention of 108%.

Our Consumer Mobile business has exceeded expectations, with subscriber growth of nearly 30% as we approach the milestone of one million customers. Our focused proposition of competitive pricing, excellent network quality, and outstanding customer service continues to resonate with UK consumers.

Looking ahead, we see significant opportunities in both segments. The B2B market continues to migrate from legacy systems to cloud communications, while in consumer mobile, we are well-positioned to continue taking market share. Our 5G network expansion will support premium offerings and drive ARPU growth.

We remain confident in achieving our target of one million mobile subscribers by March 2026, while continuing to grow our B2B business and expand margins."
