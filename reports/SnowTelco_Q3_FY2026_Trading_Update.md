## CEO Statement

**Sarah Chen, Chief Executive Officer, commented:**

"Achieving one million mobile subscribers is a transformational milestone for SnowTelco. When we launched our consumer mobile service, many questioned whether a challenger could succeed against the established operators. Today's announcement demonstrates that our strategy of combining excellent network quality, competitive pricing, and outstanding customer service resonates with UK consumers.

Our B2B business continues to perform well, with AI-powered features driving both customer acquisition and retention. The integration of AI across our UCaaS and CCaaS platforms positions us well for the next phase of growth.

With excellent momentum across both segments, we are upgrading our full-year guidance and look forward to building on this success in Q4 and beyond."
